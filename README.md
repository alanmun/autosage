A Python script with a tkinter GUI packaged as a Windows executable by Alan

**Requirements**
- Firefox 94.0.1 or later (older might work too, but I wouldn't know! The app uses Firefox to access BeatSage)

**Quick Start**
- Download this [folder](https://github.com/alanmun/autosage/tree/main/dist/autosage)
- Run "autosage.exe" (You can create a desktop shortcut to this if you'd like by right clicking)
- Follow the instructions in-app.

**Known Issues**
- Microsoft thinks its a virus lol, I have to get it signed or something to dismiss the warning
- There is a rare bug where it will fail to close Firefox (if so, you will see Firefox running in your Task Manager, you can just click on them and then click End Task to remove them)

If you find this tool really helpful, let me know! I love to hear about people benefitting from and appreciating my work :D
